## About the project

This project provides a step-by-step walkthrough to help you build a **hands-free** [Alexa Voice Service](https://developer.amazon.com/avs) (AVS) prototype in 60 minutes, using wake word engines from [Sensory](https://github.com/Sensory/alexa-rpi) or [KITT.AI](https://github.com/Kitt-AI/snowboy).

Now, in addition to pushing a button to "start listening", you can now also just say the wake word "Alexa", much like the [Amazon Echo](https://amazon.com/echo). You can find step-by-step instructions to set up the hands-free prototype on [Raspberry Pi](../../wiki/Raspberry-Pi), or follow the instructions to set up the push-to-talk only prototype on [Linux](../../wiki/Linux), [Mac](../../wiki/Mac), or [Windows](../../wiki/Windows).
